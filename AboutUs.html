<h1>About Us </h1>
<p>Meccariello Photography was established in 2022 when I purchased my first camera. I have always been fascinated with nature’s beauty and being outdoors, which inspired me to start capturing moments through my lens.
  What began as a simple passion quickly grew into a creative pursuit focused on preserving genuine emotion, natural light, and authentic experiences.
  My goal is to tell meaningful stories through photography and create images that feel timeless and true to each moment </p>
